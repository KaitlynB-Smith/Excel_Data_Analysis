# Global Landslide Data Analysis - Excel
Understanding the drivers behind global landslide events is crucial for mitigation and prevention. This project utilizes Excel and Tableau to clean, explore, and visualize a global landslide dataset. The goal of this project is to identify patterns in landslide frequency, pinpoint factors that contribute to their destructive nature, and provide a deeper understanding of global landslide trends.

# Data Cleaning
**Goals of Data Cleaning** <br>
1. Find and Delete Any Duplicates
2. Standardize and Reformat Columns
3. Find and Populate Null Values
4. Delete Unused Columns
5. Creating Columns

---

## Finding and Deleting Duplicates
Finding and deleting duplicates was accomplished by navigating to the Data tab in Excel and choosing 'Remove Duplicates', ensuring that the box was checked to indicate that the data table had headers.

|Finding Duplicates|No Duplicates Found|
|---|---|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d67fbf67-0bff-4a0e-a423-a857f0214d05) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/952f998c-b903-47c4-bbef-f1428d61fa85)|

---

## Finding Null Values
There are 'unknown' and null records in multiple columns within the dataset. The =COUNTBLANK() function was used to count the number of nulls in each column, and the =COUNTIF() function was used to count the number of 'unknown' values in each column (A -  AE).

| |  |
|---|---|
| **Counting Blank Values:** <br> ```=COUNTBLANK(A2:A11034)``` <br> <br> <br> **Counting 'unknown' Values:** <br> ```=COUNTIF(A2:A11034, "unknown")```   |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e364d180-bf19-48af-a238-603685cfaea8) |

<br>
The 'event_time' column has 11,033 nulls; however, the event times are located in the 'event_date' column. This column will be used to populate the 'event_time' column.

---

## Reformatting Columns
### Populating event_time
The 'event_date' column is formatted *mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM* and will be used to populate the 'event_time' column by utilizing Text-to-Columns.


| | | | 
|---|---|---|
|Original Data Type: Fixed Width | Move break line | Skip import for date column, import time into event_time column |
| ![Screenshot 2025-02-27 161237](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc68b68-e949-40d9-8c55-3a9d5b436944) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cdfe312-58c2-441e-a476-d181bd0bdb1f) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7d01db7-36a4-4508-9f14-f84c283ded41) |

<br> 

### Reformatting Columns
Now, the 'event_date' column is reformatted from *mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM* to *mm/dd/yyyy*, and the 'event_time' column is reformatted from *hh:mm:ss AM/PM* to *h:mm*.

| | | |

## Populating Columns
Nulls and unknowns are populated using filtering and conditional formatting. Columns that will be populated include, lanslide_trigger, country_name, and admin_division_name

|Populated Columns | Initial Nulls | Populated Nulls | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **landslide_trigger** | 23 nulls, 1691 unknowns | 8 nulls, 2 unknowns | The 'event_description' is used to populate the null values. The 'storm_name' column also allowed to populate the unknown values. |
| **country_name** | 1,562 | 1,562 |Often, the 'location_description' and 'event_title' columns contain the admin_division_names or country names which could then be be used to populate the 'country' column. Further, sorting the countries by 'latitude' and 'longitude' columns allows further population of the country column. |
| **admin_division_name** | 1,637 | 1,637 | By filtering each country, the 'admin_division_name' can be found in the 'event_title' and 'location_description' columns. Admin division can occasionally be determined using ranges of latitudes and longitudes. |

---

## Deleting Columns
Some columns are either unable to be populated or are unnecessary for analysis. The following columns are deleted from the dataset.
- **source_name**: not necessary for analysis 
- **source_link**: not necessary for analysis 
- **event_title**: not necessary for analysis 
- **event_description**: not necessary for analysis 
- **location_description**: not necessary for analysis 
- **location_accuracy**: not necessary for analysis 
- **storm_name**: not necessary for analysis 
- **photo_link**: not necessary for analysis 
- **notes**: not necessary for analysis 
- **event_import_source**: not necessary for analysis 
- **event_import_id**: not necessary for analysis 
- **country_code**: not necessary for analysis 
- **admin_division_population**: not necessary for analysis 
- **gazeteer_closest_point**: not necessary for analysis 
- **gazeteer_distance**: not necessary for analysis 
- **submitted_date**: not necessary for analysis 
- **created_date**: not necessary for analysis 
- **last_edited_date**: not necessary for analysis 
- **landslide_category**: 69% of column data is comprised of the value 'landslide' - requires greater specificity to consider analyzing 
- **landslide_setting**: 57% of column data contains either null or unknown values  
- **injury_count**: 50% of column data contains nulls 

---

## Deleting Rows
Nulls remain in the 'landslide_trigger', 'landslide_size', and 'fatality_count' columns. These records are either deleted or repopulated with 'NULL', as these columns are used in the exploration, analysis, and visualizations.

|Column Name | Count of Nulls | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| landslide_trigger | 15 | The rows containing the 15 nulls are deleted, as these rows contain less than 1% of the data in the table and will not greatly impact analysis. |
| landslide_size | 9 | The rows containing the 9 nulls are deleted, as these rows contain less than 1% of the data in the table and will not greatly impact analysis. |
| fatality_count |  1385 | These records are populated with the value 'NULL' to ensure they are not factored into later calculations. |

<br>

When filtering the data, it's discovered that there are 45 rows of data that date before 2007. These rows are deleted to obtain a more accurate annual landslide analysis.

---

## Adding Columns
The column 'event_year' is added to easily analyze landslide data.  This is accomplished using the following function:

```
=YEAR(event_date)
```
